# SNAKE GAME

I made this Snake game to help me learn Python curses.

To play:
1. Download the game files as a zip archive.
2. Extract the contents to a directory of your choice.
3. Open CMD.
4. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
5. Run the Python script with the command: `python snake.py`.
6. Choose the number of apples you want in play.
7. Use the arrow keys to move.
8. You can resize the CMD screen to your preferred size; the thinner it is, the easier it becomes.
